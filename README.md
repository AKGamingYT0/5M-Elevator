## Configuration:
All configuration actions are available in the [config.lua file](https://github.com/Maximus7474/5M-Elevator/blob/1.0.1/shared/config.lua).
To add more elevators copy the template and alter the values by respecting the structure, not respecting it will lead to errors and the resource not working properly.

- The `vehicle` & `restricted` fields are not yet active, more documentation will be made available when implemented.
- The index of the floors table needs to be a string and is suggested to not be longer than 3 characters long.
